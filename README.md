## Let's make a programming language. What could go wrong?

L# is a dynamic programming language that is compiled into C# code.

***

## Features
### Dynamic
Everything is dynamic in L#. Is this good? Only time will tell.

### Simple, easy syntax
<pre><code>public var Foo ? @Bar >> (args) =>
    args ?? ?: return args ? 1 : -1; break;</code></pre>
Or maybe not.

### Variable usefulness
This is an experiment. It may be useful, or it may hold no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

### On the shoulders of giants
L# makes use of ANTLR and the .NET Platform to look nice.

***

## Requirements
To use the L# Compiler, you need the .NET Core 2.0 Runtime, available [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).

.NET Core 2.0 is compatible with Windows, macOS, RHEL, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS and SUSE, and is also available as a Docker image.
